# Universal Parser

Copy/paste your (or someone else's) email signature, and have Universal Parser identify what the name is, what the address is, what the phone numbers are and so on. This is what the Universal Parser does. The parser uses Machine Learning and Named Entity Resolution to make the best guesses about what content represents what piece of information.

The Universal Parser product is in a "Patent pending" state and I'm proud to have been the lead inventor and contributor to the patenting process, too.

# Data Improver

With Data Improver we created an easy-to-use web interface to get rather complex Data Quality results for the UK mailing market.

The solution provided address correction, change of address updates and more, and was an instant success for Neopost UK. It was fully developed in the 4-person team that I managed in the Danish Quadient R&D office.

# YACS

Yet Another Course System. This system was used (and is probably still in use today) at Lund&Bendsen to manage the course descriptions, enrollments, material handouts and assignments for their many professional training courses.
