# The wood log speaker

OK, I admit this was pretty weird. But a nice project, turning a big log of wood into a stage prop and an secondary speaker for my guitar amplifier. And it worked really well when I played in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4NxOYLN6f7ZQdBvQQkfmr2">GoatHawkBuffalo</a>.

# Pumpkins.dk

Back in year 2000 I had an epiphany when seeing The Smashing Pumpkins live at their farewell tour in Copenhagen. It caused me to want to connect with more fans, so I launched the website pumpkins.dk, or Danish Smashing Pumpkins Forum.

For several years it remained the main online social website related to Smashing Pumpkins, with discussions, social events and gatherings, private bootleg trading and more.

# Doom3.dk

At the time Quake and Counter Strike where the most popular online games. ID Software announced that their next game would be the third installment in the Doom series and I jumped the gun to get the doom3.dk domain and set up a news and community site discussing the game as it was being developed.

We ended up being an editorial team of 4 writers, publishing news daily and getting a lot of visitors. On days where new screenshots or demos where revealed, doom3.dk would be one of the main places to find it.
