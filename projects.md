Some of my public projects ...

# DataCleaner <span class="headerlink">([website](https://datacleaner.org))</span>

The premier open source data quality solution. I founded DataCleaner back in 2008 as part of my studies. Since partnered with [Human Inference](http://www.humaninference.com) and [Neopost EDS](http://www.neopost.com) to offer it as a commercial solution, too.

DataCleaner is a data scientists' toolkit for many if not all of the phases in data quality management. Data ingestion, wrangling, profiling, transformation, cleansing, deduplication and enrichment.

# Apache MetaModel <span class="headerlink">([website](https://metamodel.apache.org))</span>

Apache MetaModel provides a uniform API for interacting with a very wide variety of datastores. I'm very proud to be PMC Chair for this Apache project that I worked with Human Inference to contribute to the Apache Software Foundation.

# .NET plugin for Apache Maven <span class="headerlink">(repo: [dotnet-maven-plugin](https://github.com/kaspersorensen/dotnet-maven-plugin))</span>

A plugin that allows you to use Apache Maven to orchestrate `dotnet` builds. At Satori Software we use this plugin a lot in order to orchestrate the build, test and release life cycle.

# Blinkt! Jenkins monitor <span class="headerlink">(repo: [blinkt-jenkins-monitor](https://github.com/kaspersorensen/blinkt-jenkins-monitor))</span>

A for-fun project that uses the Blinkt! LED lamps on my Raspberry Pi to show the status of the latest builds on my Jenkins server.

# Kafka record-updater <span class="headerlink">(repo: [kafka-record-updater](https://github.com/kaspersorensen/kafka-record-updater))</span>

An experimental tool used to edit/scramble messages in [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org). The tool is not at all recommended for production use, since it is not kept up to date with the latest Kafka releases. But it did serve as a very convenient tool to ensure that private data could be removed from the persistent (and usually immutable) events in a Kafka event stream.
